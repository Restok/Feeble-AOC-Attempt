# Feeble-AOC-Attempt
My attempt at advent of code, stopped after 6 days.

All the inputs are in the original py file, instead of a separate file. I know, it's bad, but it was convienient for me given that I coded it in an online code editor.

Everyday's puzzle is in a single file as well for the same reason.
